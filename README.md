Main javascript file is [www/assets/js/maybina.js](https://github.com/Strauman/busstavle.com/tree/master/www/assets/js/maybina.js), css file is [www/assets/css/master.css](https://github.com/Strauman/busstavle.com/tree/master/www/assets/css/master.css) and index in [www/index.html](https://github.com/Strauman/busstavle.com/tree/master/www/index.html).

There is a ruby server in between the javascript and tromskortet. This script is running on [https://www.busstavle.com:4576](https://www.busstavle.com:4576) using sinatra.
I'll published it when I've finished cleaning the code and such.
